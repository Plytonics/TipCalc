# TipCalc
Tip Calculator

Description

The goal of our project application is to construct a working app that allows a user to calculate the required tip based on number of people, cost of bill, and tip percent the user would like to pay. The functions of the application will allow the user to either split the check with everyone or know the total tip amount. The ability to have text boxes and drop downs will allow easier access to the user to navigate more affectively across the interface.
